Latex Template for the Syntax & Semantics exam @ AAU

This should hold the needed code templates for creating Finite Automatas, and semantic transisiotns, along with a bunch of relevant math-symbols and their LaTeX code.

If something seems to be missing, make a pull request, or simply create an issue.

Feel free to share with others in need :).
